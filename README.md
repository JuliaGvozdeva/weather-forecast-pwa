# Weather forecast
Deploy [https://pages.github.com/]: https://juliagvozdeva.github.io/weather-forecast/

All requirements are met. Implemented all blocks.
## Difficulties:
There were problems with styling native selects. A separate component was implemented as a select for city selection.
Some variables and function arguments were not typed. CSS property column-gap (row-gap) doesn't work for the browsers with type: edge and safari. Safari browser doesn't have native input with type='date'.
